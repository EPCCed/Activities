# Outreach
This repository contains a description of EPCC/ARCHER outreach activities. Various practical activities
are described that can be used to demonstrate the benefits of parallel/supercomputing to the general
public and young people. If you go on to use any of these we would love to hear about it - drop me an
[email](mailto:m.antonioletti@epcc.ed.ac.uk). If you would like to contribute then let me know what your
GitHub id is and I will add you to the repository.
