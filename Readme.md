# Outreach

This repository contains a description of EPCC/ARCHER outreach
activities. Various practical activities are described that can be
used to demonstrate the benefits of parallel/supercomputing to the
general public and/or young people.

If you go on to use any of these we would love to hear about it -
drop us an [email](mailto:m.antonioletti@epcc.ed.ac.uk) with any
feedback. If you would like to contribute then please fork the
repository and issue a pull request with your contributions.
