# Sorting

Demonstrate in a simple and effective manner the benefits of doing
tasks in parallel.

## Learning objectives

* Multiple people sorting will do more than one person in the same
  time or it will take less time to achieve the same end.
   * Modern parallel computers operate on the same principle.


## Equipment

The equipment required for this activity is relatively simple
and can go as far as your budget will streach. The miniumum
set-up would be:

* A set of coloured balls.
* A box or bag to contain the balls. This is the sorting source.
* As many smaller boxes as there are colours - these are the sorting sinks.
* A sheet of A3 with a pen to note the scores/sticky dots
