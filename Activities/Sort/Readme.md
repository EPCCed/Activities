# Sorting

Demonstrate in a simple and effective manner the benefits of doing
tasks in parallel.

## Learning objectives

* Multiple people sorting will do more than one person in the same
  time or it will take less time to achieve the same end.
   * Modern parallel computers operate on the same principle.


## Equipment

The equipment required for this activity is relatively simple
and can go as far as your budget will streach. The miniumum
set-up would be:

* A set of coloured balls or bean bags.
* A box or bag to contain the balls. This is the sorting source.
* As many smaller boxes as there are colours - these are the sorting sinks.
* A timer (digital or analogue) that can count down 30s or 1min.
* A sheet of A3 with a pen to note the scores/sticky dots.

Label each of the boxes with the colour that it is supposed to act as a sink for -
you can either print a label (good to use coloured lables so that green is in green
ink for those that are too young to read) for each box or you could get coloured 
boxes/trugs that match the colour of the objects that you are trying to sort.

You can be as sophistcated as you like. We started off with simple boxes and now
use trugs placed on a flower stand and have changed the balls for small pyramid
bean bags. The one thing that you do need to be careful with is that the action
at the ball source container can get a little bit frenetic so make sure that there
are no sharp edges or hard bits that could cause damage to young hands.

## Scenario

To run this activity place the ball source and surround this by the ball sinks.
