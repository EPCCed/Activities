# Sorting

Demonstrate in a simple and effective manner the benefits of doing
tasks in parallel.

## Learning objectives

* Multiple people sorting will do more than one person in the same
  time or it will take less time to achieve the same end.
   * Modern parallel computers operate on the same principle.


## Equipment

The equipment required for this activity is relatively simple
and can go as far as your budget will stretch. The minimum
set-up would be:

* A set of coloured balls or bean bags.
* A box or bag to contain the balls. This is the sorting source.
* As many smaller boxes as there are colours - these are the sorting sinks.
* A timer (digital or analogue) that can count down 30s or 1min.
* A sheet of A3 with a pen to note the scores/sticky dots.

Label each of the boxes with the colour that it is supposed to act
as a sink for - you can either print a label (good to use coloured
labels so that green is in green ink for those that are too young
to read, here is a [pdf&nbsp;file](pdf/SortingLabels.pdf) you could
use to this end) for each box or you could get coloured boxes/trugs
that match the colour of the objects that you are trying to sort.

You can be as sophisticated as you like. We started off with simple
boxes:

moved on to use trugs and a boxes:

and now use trugs placed on a flower stand and have changed the
balls for small pyramid bean bags. The one thing that you do need
to be careful with is that the action at the ball source container
can get a little bit frenetic so make sure that there are no sharp
edges or hard bits that could cause damage to young hands.

## Scenario

To run this activity place the coloured object source and place the
ball sinks nearby. You can optionally prepare an A3 sheet with the
numbered of colour objects you have along the y-axis and the number
of people involved in the activity on the x-axis (see the diagram
below), you can then get your participants to register their scores
as they complete the activity.

Explain to your audience that you are going to demonstrate the
benefits of parallelism. Tell them that they can only use one hand
and only process one object at a time so if you are using coloured
balls you are only supposed to use hand with one ball at a time - 
this helps to control participation. You then:

* Get one person to sort as many coloured objects as they can in 30s. 
* Count the objects they have done. Note down the score and/or get the participant
  to add a sticky dot to the chart as shown below.
* Make sure the objects are well shuffled in the source container.
* Now get more than one person to carry out the same task. You can repeat with as 
  many people as you have in the group.

Try to get as many people involved in the process, so while one person is sorting
another can be the time keeper.
