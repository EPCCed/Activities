# Activities

Each directory contains a description and the materials required to run each activity. We have:

* `Sort` - an embarrassingly parallel demonstration of the benefits of parallelism.
* `PostalSort` - another embarrassingly parallel sort but slightly more complicated than the `Sort` activity.
* `ParallelSums` - calculating the sum of a list of numbers using a master-slave paradigm and a peerless one.
* `MessagePassingSort` - sorting a distributed list of numbers. This requires some explanation so not ideally
   suited to a high throughput environment.

## To be done

* `ParallelWordCount` - a parallel word count activity modelled on MapReduce.
