# Information about Wee Archie and Wee Archlet

Wee Archie is a model super computer we can take to events consisting of
networked Raspberry Pis. There are two models - a blue and green. The 
colour refers to the colour of the LEDs each system employs - blue is a
slightly more up to date system. The Archie name is derived from the 
ARCHER super computing service run in the UK, Wee (for small) reflects
the Scottish heritage. Wee Archlet is a cut down version with only a
few Raspberry Pis networked together. We have provided instructions
on [how to build your own Wee Archlet](https://epcced.github.io/wee_archlet) 
elsewhere.
