# The Dictionary Definitions

**Oxford Dictionary**: An electronic device which is capable of receiving information (data) in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions (program) to produce a result in the form of information or signals.

# What does it mean for us?
Computers are now a part of daily life.

Modern science, engineering and medicine are dependent on computers for progress and operation.

Modern Communications rely on computers in many forms.

Increased availability of news and culture around the world.

Important that we understand the capabilities and limitations of computers

----

# Important
Computers are tools.

People have to use them sensibly.

Don't use them for tasks they are not suitable for.

# What is a Supercomputer?

----

# Aims

* Describe what a Supercomputer is
* Describe the uses of a superomputer
* Describe why supercomputers are needed


----

# Why?

Why would we use a supercomputer or any computer in science?

* Experiments - we can do experiments on computers to help design, supplement or carry out ideas that otherwise wouldn't be possible
* Data Processing - experiments and sensors generate lots of data
* Visualisation - a method for showing how results were created and to allow exploration of data
* Speed - computers are faster at almost every type of calculation and less prone to careless error

----

# Why? 

Why could we not do some experiments?

* Dangerous - looking at volcano eruptions and effects
* Too Large - understanding how the universe formed
* Too Small - understanding how things work at the atomic or subatomic level
* Hard to Repeat - doing certain actions in the same way in the same conditions can be difficult
* Cost - some experiments are really expensive

----

# Why? 

Better experiment design

* Cost - some experiments are really expensive, doing preliminary work on computers can eliminate dead ends
* Lower Effects - side-effects of experiments can be wide-ranging - better design helps to minimise this

Supplement Experiments

* Hard to Repeat - computers can help with data recording and can be used to explore existing data in new ways
* Data Sampling - computers can filter and record data better than people - particularly in high speed experiments 

----

# Why?              

Speed 

* Computers process calculations really quickly
* Can iterate through experiments or result data
* Example: Vehicle Design - can eliminate poor designs  and concentrate on more viable ideas while retaining a breadth of options

----

# Types

Generally activites are broken into two main types

* Data Processing - processing data from an experiment
* Simulation - a virtual experiment

----

# Bigger, Faster

If we have computers, why do we need supercomputers?

The computers we are used to are fast, they can process data far more rapidly than a person can. However, for a lot of scientific computing even the fastest desktop is insufficient.

Part of this is less about speed and more about size, often the problems being examined are too large for a desktop computer to deal with.

Simluating the formation of the galaxy could be done on a desktop but it wouldn't be as accurate, it wouldn't be as fast and for science purposes not that useful.

----

# Bigger, Faster

If the data we get from a computer isn't accurate enough, it is not that much use to us for scientific research.

So we need to be able to run big problems, but also they need to run in an acceptable amount of time - hours rather than months or years.

So we use supercomputers - these machines can deal with huge problems like the design of an aircraft or the formation of a planet and do experiments in hours rather then months.

And for the scientists this makes life easier, they can do research quicker or explore more options.

----

# A Supercomputer

A supercomputer is not just a single massive computer - 

A supercomputer is a collection of smaller computers connected together.

Isn't that just like the internet?


----

# A Supercomputer

No - the internet is a collection of computers which can talk but all operate on different things and talk slowly to each other.

A supercomputer is designed and put together so that the computers in it talk to each other at really high speeds so they can share calculation data.

A supercomputer contains computers which are as similar in their core to a desktop but have all the extras stripped away so that each of them can operate efficiently on the work they are given.



----

# A Supercomputer

A supercomputer at a high level has these parts:

* Compute Nodes - these do all the work
* Power System - supplies and regulates the electricity
* Cooling System - computers get warm, supercomputers more so
* Network - highly optimised, high speed network coommunications.
* File System - a shared filesystem across the network to allow data sharing
* Job Submission System - this is where you submit your program to run

----

# Uses

Supercomputers are used for large problems, though large is in terms of how much computational processing is required. Often looking at really small things requires a lot of computing power to process.

Supercomputers have been used for:
* Galaxy Formation Simulation
* Climate Modelling
* Weather Prediction
* Vehicle Design

Supercomputers can be used for any system or field that can be reduced to rules and calculations, even if the computer develops these without us understanding them.


----

# Example - ARCHER

ARCHER is the current UK National Supercomputing Service. 

ARCHER is a Cray XC30 MPP supercomputer used by scientists across the UK to support their research and development.

There are 118,080 processor cores supported by 307.5 Terabytes of memory in total on 4920 nodes - this takes up a lot of space but provides a lot of computing power.

----

# Case Studies

Supercomputers are used for a range of different applications. The [ARCHER website](http://www.archer.ac.uk/casestudies/) contains case studies on selected applications. 

A selection of these include:

A personalised approach to computational heart modelling - looking at better support for heart related medical care.

Disovering Dinosaur footprints - looking are how evolutionary biology is supported and how modern animals can be placed in context with evolutionary pressures.
