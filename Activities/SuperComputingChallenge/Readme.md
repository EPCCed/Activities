# Supercomputing Challenge

## Background

EPCC has created a web
application,
[archer&nbsp;challenge](https://archer-webapps.epcc.ed.ac.uk/challenge),
that allows user to simulate the running of a computer centre.  A user
starts with an initial budget that they can use to purchase a computer
system for their centre.  Income is then generated by running
jobs. This cash allows the player to buy new nodes and or upgrade the
hardware and thus is able to run more and bigger jobs which in turn
generates more income. Some budget must also be maintained to allow
for unforseen events to be addressed such as repairing node failures
which require cash to repair.

## Objectives

* Keep the computer centre running for as long as possible.
* Upgrade and/or buy more hardware to run more jobs or jobs that have
  larger requirements.

## Learning objectives

* Become aware that better hardware allows you to tackle existing jobs
  faster or bigger jobs.

## Equipment

* A networked connection is required to enable the supercomputing
  application to be run. A desktop/laptop with a web browser.

## Method

The game initially requires a little bit of explanation but once
the basics have been gone over the game is relatively self evident. More
nodes allows the throughput of jobs to increase, more powerful hardware
allows bigger jobs to be run that generate more income. A leaderboard
allows individuals to add their name to the top scores.

## Discussion points

* What is the best strategy?
