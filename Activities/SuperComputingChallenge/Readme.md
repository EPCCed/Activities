# Supercomputing Challenge

## Background

EPCC has generated a web app,
[archer&nbsp;challenge](https://archer-webapps.epcc.ed.ac.uk/challenge),
that allows user to simulate the running of a computer centre.  The
user starts with a finite budget which they use to purchase a base
computer system.  Income is generated by running jobs, this allows
the user to upgrade the hardware and thus run more jobs. The budget
must be maintained and allow for unforseen events to be addressed
such as node failures which will require cash to repair.

## Objectives

* Keep the computer centre running for as long as possible.

## Learning objectives

* Become aware that better hardware allows you to tackle existing jobs faster or bigger jobs.

## Equipment

* A networked connection that enables the supercomputing app to be run and the hardware to 
  run it.

## Method


## Discussion points

*
